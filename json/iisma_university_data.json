The first Rector was Monsignor Joaqu\u00edn Larra\u00edn Gandarillas, and the first two faculties were Law, Physical Sciences, and Math. Despite the changes, the university has always aimed at achieving a solid education founded on the sciences, arts, humanities, and Catholic morals. Thus, the university aims for its students to be not only technically and scientifically prepared but also to be open to different human realities and the social and personal responsibilities involved in the complete development of society. Throughout the university\u2019s history, this first aim has been continuously fulfilled. UC Chile is the best university in the country, the first university in Latin America, and number 103 according to the QS world ranking (2024).
